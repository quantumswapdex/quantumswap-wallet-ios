// QuantumSwapAddress.swift (Components layer)
// Strict shape validator for QuantumCoin's 0x-prefixed 32-byte
// addresses (64 hex characters after the prefix).
// this validator is a SHAPE-ONLY pre-filter for synchronous
// Swift call sites that need a same-thread answer
// (filesystem path safety, URL composition safety, Keychain
// item identifier safety - the confused-deputy class enumerated
// below). It MUST NOT be used as the canonical "is this an
// address?" gate for user-intent surfaces. The canonical gate
// is `JsBridge.isValidAddress` which calls
// `QuantumSwapSDK.isAddress` inside the WebView - that call is
// the SDK-of-record. This split exists because:
//   * Synchronous call sites (path safety) cannot block on a
//     WebView round-trip.
//   * The SDK might in future tighten its validation (e.g. add
//     a checksum requirement for unprefixed inputs); the
//     synchronous regex must not silently disagree.
// If you find yourself adding a "validate this user-typed
// address" call here, route through `JsBridge.isValidAddress`
// instead. The Send screen does this in `tapSend` (see
// `SendViewController.swift`).
// Rationale:
// The wallet treats an "address" as a primary identifier in many
// places: filesystem paths (backup file names), Keychain item
// identifiers, RPC URL path components, dedup keys, signing-target
// labels in the review dialog. Almost every one of those use sites
// trusts the address it receives without checking that it is even
// well-formed - because the originating layer ALSO trusted whoever
// handed it the address. That is a confused-deputy hole: a single
// untrusted-input source (a `.wallet` file the user picked, a deep
// link, an external app's share intent, a malformed pasteboard
// value) can flow an attacker-controlled string into all of the
// above.
// This validator is the single source of truth for "is this thing
// even an address?". Every layer that uses an address-shaped value
// as a primary identifier MUST go through `QuantumSwapAddress.isValid`
// (or `QuantumSwapAddress.normalized`) before forwarding the value
// to:
// - any filesystem operation (path-traversal attack class)
// - any URL composition (URL-injection attack class)
// - any Keychain item identifier (item-collision attack class)
// - any signing-target identity check (signing-spoof attack class)
// The regex `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{64}$` rejects the path-traversal class
// (`..`, `/`, `\`, NUL, whitespace, control characters) by simple
// construction: the only characters that match are the literal `0x`
// followed by 64 hex digits. Nothing else passes.
// Why 32 bytes?
// QuantumCoin uses 32-byte (256-bit) addresses, which is the
// natural digest size of the post-quantum signature scheme
// that produces the wallet's public-key commitments. An
// earlier 20-byte regex copied verbatim from a 20-byte
// address scheme silently rejected every real wallet file
// as "missing or malformed address" - which is the
// regression this validator's correct 32-byte shape closes.
// The current shape is compatible with every wallet file
// ever produced by either the iOS or Android client.
// Tradeoffs:
// - The validator does NOT verify any checksum semantics. Most
// stored addresses arrive in either all-lower or all-upper
// case form. Mixed-case is accepted because it falls in the
// same character class - the validator only checks shape.
// The user-facing display path will re-encode in
// mixed-case for the transaction review dialog so a typo is
// visually surfaced; that is a UX fix, not an input-validation
// fix.
// - The validator does NOT verify the address corresponds to a
// real on-chain account. That is impossible without a network
// round trip and would not catch the path-traversal class
// anyway. Use this validator for shape checking; use signing-
// time signature verification for identity binding.
// - The validator is fixed at 32 bytes (64 hex). A future chain
// migration that changes the address length would require a
// coordinated update to this file AND to any persisted
// `.wallet` file format that embeds the address.
