// Pasteboard.swift (UX layer)
// Hardened wrapper around `UIPasteboard.general` for
// sensitive material (seed phrases, mnemonics, private keys, wallet
// addresses, transaction hashes).
// Why a wrapper exists at all:
// The default `UIPasteboard.general.string =` shape that the app used
// to call has two security-relevant defaults that are wrong for a
// wallet that holds high-value assets:
// 1. **Universal Clipboard.** iOS 10+ replicates pasteboard items to
// every other Apple device signed into the same iCloud account
// within seconds, with no UI signal to the user. A copied seed
// phrase therefore reaches the user's MacBook, iPad, and any
// other iPhone they have within reach. `[.localOnly: true]` opts
// the item out of that replication.
// 2. **Indefinite persistence.** The default item lives on the
// clipboard until the user (or another app) overwrites it.
// Anything launched in the meantime - the QuickType bar, a
// clipboard manager, a sandbox-escaping app - sees the value.
// `[.expirationDate: ...]` causes iOS to evict the item after
// the chosen lifetime even if nothing else is copied.
// These two options together turn a copied seed phrase from "leaks
// to every device for hours" into "stays on this device for a minute".
// They do NOT defend against:
// - On-device clipboard scrapers running while the value is fresh
// (impossible to defend in user mode; nothing the wallet can do).
// - Screen-recording / screen-capture tools that grabbed the value
// before the user copied it ( covers the snapshot path).
// Tradeoff (summary):
// The user can no longer paste the copied value on a different device
// of theirs. This is a deliberate scope reduction matching the
// wallet's threat model: high-value secrets should not leave the
// device that produced them. The default lifetime is tuned to be
// just long enough that a reasonable user can switch to the target
// app and paste, then the OS evicts the item even if nothing else
// is copied. Per-call override is supported for the rare site that
// can prove a longer or shorter window is appropriate.
// the previous default was 60 s; lowered to 30 s because:
//   * Every existing call site is either a seed-phrase copy
//     (already overrode to 30 s) or a wallet-address / tx-hash
//     copy (the user pastes within seconds; 30 s is generous).
//   * Halving the residual-exposure window halves the surface
//     for an on-device clipboard scraper that polls
//     `UIPasteboard.general.changeCount`.
//   * 30 s remains comfortably above the 5-10 s an unhurried
//     user takes to switch apps, find the destination field,
//     and paste.
// Lint contract (verification §10):
// Any call to `UIPasteboard.general.string = ...`,
// `UIPasteboard.general.setValue(...)`, or
// `UIPasteboard.general.setItems(...)` outside this file is a
// build-blocking review failure. The wrapper is the ONLY pathway
// through which the app touches the system pasteboard. New "Copy"
// affordances must call `Pasteboard.copySensitive`.
