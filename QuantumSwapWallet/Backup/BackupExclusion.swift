// BackupExclusion.swift (Backup layer - iCloud/Finder backup gating)
// Single source of truth for honouring the user's "Phone Backup"
// toggle (`PrefKeys.BACKUP_ENABLED_KEY`). When the user opts OUT
// the strongbox slot files are flagged with
// `URLResourceKey.isExcludedFromBackupKey = true` so they are
// excluded from iCloud Backup AND unencrypted Finder backups; when
// the user opts IN the flag is cleared so the files travel with
// the standard phone-backup mechanism.
// Why this exists:
// The pref `BACKUP_ENABLED_KEY` is collected on first-launch and
// exposed as a settings row. Until this helper landed, the pref
// was persisted but never enforced - the strongbox file was
// ALWAYS in iCloud Backup regardless of the toggle state. That
// broke the user-visible promise made by the settings row's
// description string ("encrypted wallet data will be included
// in phone backups").
// This file closes that gap. Every successful strongbox write
// re-applies the resource value (so the flag survives a write
// that recreates the file via .tmp -> rename). Settings and
// first-launch toggles re-apply immediately so the user does
// not have to wait for the next strongbox mutation to see the
// change take effect.
// The pref is the SOLE source of truth for the backup-enabled
// toggle. The encrypted payload does not carry a `backupEnabled`
// field at all (see `StrongboxPayload.swift` and Android's
// `StrongboxPayload.java` for the matching schema). The pref is
// consulted because:
//   1. The toggle is captured BEFORE the strongbox exists
//      (during first-launch onboarding). At that moment there is
//      no decrypted snapshot to read.
//   2. The slot-file write may run while the strongbox is locked
//      (e.g. a future background-rewrite path) - the in-memory
//      Strongbox.shared snapshot is unavailable while locked, so
//      the OS-level backup decision must come from a pre-unlock
//      surface. The pref is the only such surface.
//   3. The OS backup agent (the iCloud Backup orchestrator) reads
//      `isExcludedFromBackup` resource values WITHOUT unlocking
//      the wallet; if the source-of-truth lived inside the
//      encrypted payload, the agent could never honour it
//      pre-unlock and the toggle would silently leak the wallet
//      file into backups against the user's wishes.
// Tradeoffs (what this flag does and does NOT control):
// - DOES exclude the file from iCloud Backup.
// - DOES exclude the file from unencrypted Finder/iTunes backups.
// - Does NOT exclude the file from ENCRYPTED Finder/iTunes
// backups. Apple's platform behaviour is that an encrypted
// local backup includes Keychain items AND ALL app sandbox
// data regardless of `isExcludedFromBackupKey`. There is no
// public API to opt out. A user who creates an encrypted
// iTunes/Finder backup and types "no" to this toggle WILL
// still have the strongbox in that backup. The settings copy
// should make this clear.
// - Does NOT affect `.wallet` exports the user explicitly drops
// into iCloud Drive or shares via the document picker. Those
// are user-driven export operations with a separate intent;
// the toggle here scopes only to the implicit phone-backup
// mechanism.
// - The flag is a STORAGE attribute, not a content guarantee.
// The strongbox is AEAD-sealed under a scrypt-derived key
// regardless of the toggle. Excluding it from backup adds an
// EXFIL-PATH defense: an attacker who steals an iCloud Backup
// of the user's device cannot extract the strongbox from
// that backup. The attacker still cannot recover the wallet
// from the strongbox without the password (scrypt brute-force
// floor + AEAD tag).
// Layered position:
// Sits at the "Backup" layer above the storage primitive
// (`AtomicSlotWriter`) and below the user-facing screens
// (`SettingsViewController`, `HomeWalletViewController`). The
// storage primitive calls back here on every write; UI screens
// call here directly on toggle flip.
