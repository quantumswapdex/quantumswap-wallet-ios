// UrlBuilder.swift (Networking layer)
// Single source of truth for every URL the app
// composes from a base + an attacker-influenceable string segment
// (a wallet address, a token-contract address, a transaction hash).
// Why this exists:
// The app composes block-explorer URLs and API URLs by direct
// string concatenation:
// Constants.BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL +
// "/account/{address}/txn/page".replacingOccurrences(
// of: "{address}", with: raw)
// `raw` flows in from many sources:
// - The contract-address field of an ERC-20 token returned by
// the scan-API JSON (attacker-controlled if the user added a
// network whose RPC the attacker controls, which a phishing
// site can convince a user to do).
// - A QR-code scan from an arbitrary image (zero authentication).
// - A pasteboard value from any other app on the device.
// - A typed input from the recipient field on Send.
// None of those values are constrained to "0x + 40 hex" by the
// call sites. A scan-API response with `contractAddress`:
// `0xdead/../../malicious?phish=` composes a URL that, when
// passed to `UIApplication.shared.open`, pivots the user into
// Safari at the attacker's chosen origin. ATS does NOT cover
// `UIApplication.shared.open` (which routes through Safari).
// Safari then renders a phishing page that asks for the user's
// seed words.
// This helper:
// 1. Validates the substitute against the strict regex for its
// type (address: `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{64}$` — QuantumCoin
// addresses are 32 bytes / 64 hex characters; tx hash:
// `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{64}$`).
// the previous header docstring referenced the
// Ethereum `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$` (20-byte) address shape,
// which is wrong for QuantumCoin: the address validator
// `QuantumSwapAddress.isValid` (used by both call sites in
// this file) enforces 32-byte / 64-hex-char addresses. The
// two regexes are now identical in shape because both an
// address and a transaction hash are 32-byte, 64-hex-char
// 0x-prefixed values - the type tags are kept distinct for
// call-site readability and so a future address vs. tx-hash
// shape divergence remains catchable with a single helper
// signature change.
// 2. Percent-encodes the substitute for safety even after the
// regex passes (defense-in-depth; the regex already rules
// out `/`, `?`, `#`, NUL, etc., but the encode step is the
// invariant the URL spec requires).
// 3. Returns `nil` on any validation failure so the caller
// falls back to a no-op (the user sees nothing happen rather
// than being pivoted to Safari).
// Lint contract (verification §10): every call to
// `replacingOccurrences(of: "{address}", with:)` and
// `replacingOccurrences(of: "{txhash}", with:)` outside this file
// is a build-blocking review failure. The wrapper is the only
// pathway through which the app composes such URLs.
// Tradeoff:
// A malformed value silently fails to open. We considered showing
// an error toast on failure, but the call sites are entry points
// the user explicitly tapped, and an error there is most likely a
// UI bug rather than an attack - so a silent no-op gives the
// least-bad UX while still defending against the URL-injection
// class.
