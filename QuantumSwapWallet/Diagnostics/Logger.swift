// Logger.swift (Diagnostics layer)
// Developer-only logging shim that:
// 1. Compiles to a no-op in Release builds (`#if DEBUG` gates the
// entire body, so `Logger.debug(...)` calls leave neither the
// message bytes nor the formatting work in the Release binary).
// 2. In DEBUG builds, redacts known-sensitive substrings BEFORE
// handing the string to `print(...)`. The redactor catches:
// * 0x-prefixed 64-hex strings (covers BOTH QuantumCoin
// addresses AND transaction hashes - both are 64 hex
// digits in this wallet, so the redactor cannot
// distinguish them and uses a single template that is
// truthful for either case)
// * any other run of >= 32 hex digits (catches private keys,
// public keys, AES-GCM ciphertexts, scrypt-derived keys
// rendered as hex)
// * any base64-shape blob >= 40 characters (catches the
// base64 envelope serialisations the JS bridge passes
// around for keys / ciphertexts / nonces)
// * any single token from the BIP-39 wordlist (catches a
// mnemonic word slipping through an exception message)
// Why it exists:
// Prior reviews flagged that bare `print(...)` and
// `console.error(...)` sites were emitting raw error context to
// Console.app and an attached debugger. In DEBUG, that context
// could carry sensitive material (a `JsBridgeError(message:)`
// surfaced from a failing decrypt has the failed envelope's bytes
// in its message; an `ApiError.other` from a 4xx body can carry a
// transaction the user just sent; the `loadTokens` path can
// surface the wallet's own address into Console because its URL
// was the one that 4xx'd).
// The defence here is two-layer:
// * Release builds: logging is gone entirely. There is nothing
// in the Release binary to leak. (The compiler is free to
// remove the `#if DEBUG` body and any string-literal arguments
// passed by call sites because the call has no side effect in
// Release.)
// * DEBUG builds: the redactor blanks out the substrings most
// likely to be sensitive before the message reaches `print`.
// This trades a little debuggability ("AEAD failed: <REDACTED-
// HEX-128>" vs the full ciphertext) for a guarantee that a
// developer running the wallet in DEBUG and screen-sharing in
// a meeting cannot accidentally splash a private key into the
// Xcode console.
// The call sites in the signing / unlock / API paths now route
// through `Logger.debug(category:_:)`. The category is an opaque
// string (e.g. `"BRIDGE_ERR"`, `"PREFS_FLUSH_FAIL"`,
// `"LOAD_TOKENS_FAIL"`) so a developer reading Console can locate
// the failing code path without seeing the failing input.
// Tradeoffs:
// - The redactor is a heuristic, not a parser. A novel encoding
// (Bech32, base58, etc.) that we have not anticipated could
// leak through. Mitigation: the call sites that pass through
// this shim are also the ones whose error messages have been
// reviewed for what they construct. Adding a new error message
// that interpolates secret material is a code-review concern
// even with the redactor in place.
// - We deliberately do NOT redact in the BIP-39 case greedily
// (a word like "above" or "actor" appearing in an English
// error sentence shouldn't be redacted). The check is "the
// word is the only token, surrounded by whitespace, in the
// message and the message looks short enough to be a leaked
// mnemonic word". This is intentionally weak; the stronger
// defence is to never let the error path serialise a mnemonic
// into a String, which is enforced by the `bridge.html`
// `zeroString` policy on payload return.
// - The Release-build no-op means a crash log captured by
// TestFlight / customer support contains zero bridge / API
// diagnostic context. We accept this: the `requestId` echoed
// by the JS bridge plus the failing function's symbol name
// in the stack trace is enough to locate the failing call
// site, and the developer can re-run in DEBUG to see the
// redacted detail.
