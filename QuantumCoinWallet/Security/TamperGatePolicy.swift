// TamperGatePolicy.swift (Security layer - policy + UI)
// Policy + UI layer that consumes the value-typed
// `TamperReport` produced by `TamperGate.swift`. This file owns the
// disclosure dialog, the persistent banner, the hard-fail dialog,
// the "consent already given" sticky bit, and the per-signing-call
// throw used by `JsBridge.send*`.
// Design discipline (notes for reviewers):
// * The probe layer (`TamperGate`) MUST stay free of UIKit and
// localization dependencies so it is unit-testable. That means
// this file is the ONLY place where the words "jailbreak",
// "debugger", "tamper" are user-shown, where the `Quit`
// button is wired to `exit(0)`, and where the
// `kTamperGateEnabled` feature flag is consumed.
// * `assertSafeToSign` is the single chokepoint at the JS
// bridge: every transaction signing call funnels through it
// before payload preparation. A regression that adds a new
// signing entry point but forgets to call `assertSafeToSign`
// is caught by the rule documented at the top of `JsBridge`:
// "the first call inside every JsBridge.sign* entry point".
// * The user-facing policy is intentionally asymmetric:
// jailbreak -> INFORMED CONSENT (one-time dialog + banner;
// user can continue at risk)
// debugger -> HARD FAIL (per-launch dialog; user can ONLY
// Quit; signing is non-overridable)
// tamper -> HARD FAIL (per-launch dialog; user can ONLY
// Quit; signing is non-overridable)
// (notes for reviewers):
// jailbreak detection uses an informed-consent dialog with a
// sticky bit -
// jailbreak signals are heuristic and a single false positive
// must not brick a legitimately-jailbroken-by-the-user device.
// Debugger and runtime-tamper detections are HARD signals with
// negligible false-positive rates (a Release build genuinely
// should not be debugged; a tampered bundle is unambiguously
// bad), and the prior behaviour - exposing an "Ignore and
// resume" action - let an opportunistic attacker who could
// produce one Frida hook bypass the entire signing-time
// re-evaluation by tapping that button once. Today the dialog
// for hard signals offers ONLY "Quit"; `assertSafeToSign`
// re-evaluates on every call and refuses signing while a hard
// signal is positive, regardless of any prior UI dismissal.
// The risk of locking out a legitimate security researcher is
// mitigated because:
// (a) DEBUG and simulator builds do not run the hard-fail
// classifier (see TamperGate file header), so a developer
// can attach Xcode's debugger normally; and
// (b) a power user who genuinely wants to instrument a
// Release build can rebuild from source with
// `kTamperGateEnabled = false`.
// * The jailbreak disclosure dialog appears EXACTLY ONCE per
// device per install. The "I have seen the disclosure" bit is
// recorded in a Keychain item (`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked
// ThisDeviceOnly`, `kSecAttrSynchronizable=false`); we use
// Keychain rather than UserDefaults so the bit survives a JSON
// pref wipe but does NOT survive a full app uninstall (iOS
// 10.3+ drops Keychain items on uninstall). Reinstalling
// resets the consent and re-shows the dialog, which is the
// correct trade-off: a fresh install has not seen the
// disclosure, so it should see it.
// * The hard-fail dialog has NO "Ignore and resume" affordance.
// An earlier design exposed that affordance and persisted no
// override state, but an in-process flag was enough to silence
// `assertSafeToSign` for the rest of the session - which
// defeated the per-call re-evaluation.
// Tradeoffs:
// - The persistent banner consumes ~28pt at the top of the
// window. In practice that pushes the existing chrome down
// slightly on a tamper-detected device; acceptable because
// the user explicitly accepted that trade-off when they
// tapped "Continue at my own risk" or "Ignore and resume".
// - The hard-fail dialog is Quit-only. A power user who
// genuinely wants to debug a Release build can
// rebuild from source with `kTamperGateEnabled = false`.
// The legitimate-jailbreak case still has the informed-
// consent path because jailbreak signals are heuristic
// (a true positive on a not-jailbroken device must not
// brick the wallet); the hard signals (debugger, runtime
// tamper) are unambiguous enough that the exit-only posture
// is the correct trade.
// - `exit(0)` is a hard process termination. Apple's Human
// Interface Guidelines discourage user-initiated process
// termination, BUT the alternative (leaving the wallet
// running after detecting a debugger or a tampered bundle
// without explicit user acknowledgement) is worse: the next
// signing call would itself be unsafe. The exit is gated
// behind a modal the user must dismiss, so the user sees the
// explanation before the process disappears.
// - The disclosure dialog uses `UIAlertController` (rather than
// the codebase's custom `ModalDialogViewController` family)
// so it is guaranteed to render correctly even if the rest of
// the UI stack is mid-construction. AppDelegate calls this
// from `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` while
// the rootViewController is still the splash; UIAlertController
// handles that case unambiguously where a custom modal would
// need an explicit presenter.
