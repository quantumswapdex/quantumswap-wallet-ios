// ScreenCaptureGuard.swift
// Screen-capture mitigation. iOS does NOT (as of iOS 17) provide a public API
// equivalent to Android's `FLAG_SECURE` that prevents the operating
// system or third-party recording apps from capturing the contents of
// a window. The closest signal Apple does expose is
// `UIScreen.main.isCaptured` (and the matching
// `UIScreen.capturedDidChangeNotification`), which becomes `true` while
// the screen is being mirrored (AirPlay, QuickTime), recorded
// (Control Center > Screen Recording), or displayed in a CarPlay /
// AirPlay receiver.
// for any
// screen that displays freshly-decrypted secret material (BIP39 seed
// words on the create-wallet reveal step, the post-unlock seed reveal
// in `RevealWalletViewController`, etc.), we attach a
// `ScreenCaptureGuard` to the protected subview. Whenever
// `UIScreen.isCaptured == true`, the protected subview is hidden and a
// warning view is shown in its place. When capture stops the warning
// view is removed and the protected subview is revealed.
// Tradeoffs:
// * iOS in-app screenshots (Power + Volume) are NOT detected by
//   `UIScreen.isCaptured`. There is `UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshot`
//   but it fires *after* the screenshot is taken; it cannot prevent the
//   screenshot. The only platform-level mitigation against in-app
//   screenshots requires private SPI (`UITextField.secureTextEntry`
//   tricks that draw the contents inside a hidden text-field layer).
//   We accept the screenshot residual risk; the VoiceOver
//   suppression and the existing 30 s pasteboard expiry plus the
//   "Click to reveal" gating already narrow the surface.
// * The hide path is best-effort: a recording app that starts capture
//   immediately while the user is staring at the seed will record the
//   transition frame. The defence is reactive, not proactive.
// * Apple-internal screen capture APIs (e.g. `_UIWindow.snapshotView`)
//   used by the OS task switcher are also not blocked here. The
//   existing app-snapshot blanker on `applicationWillResignActive`
//   covers that.
