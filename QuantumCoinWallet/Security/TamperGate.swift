// TamperGate.swift (Security layer - probes only)
// Layered runtime detection of jailbreak,
// debugger-attached-in-Release, and bundle/Mach-O tampering. This
// file is the *probe* layer: it owns no UI, no policy, no localized
// strings. The policy + UI layer lives in `TamperGatePolicy.swift`.
// The strict separation is deliberate so the security primitives can
// be unit-tested in isolation and so a future change to the policy
// (e.g. swapping in a maintained library like `IOSSecuritySuite`)
// does not have to re-touch the UI plumbing.
// Why this exists:
// Every other defense in this app rests on the OS-level isolation
// that iOS gives a sandboxed process: `.completeFileProtection`,
// Keychain access controls, App-Bound Domains, code-signing of
// the loaded image. A jailbroken device, an attached debugger, or
// a Frida-style `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` shim defeats every one of
// those. The wallet's per-transaction signing flow is the highest-
// value target: an attacker who can read process memory or hook
// `JsBridge.sendTransaction` can quietly redirect the recipient
// address right before it is signed, defeating , and
// in one move.
// This module RAISES THE COST of that attack from "one off-the-
// shelf Frida script" to "bypass-the-detection AND hook-the-
// signer". It does NOT make the attack impossible; that is not
// the bar. The bar is "the cheapest version of the attack stops
// working" which closes the hobbyist / opportunistic threat model.
// Design summary:
// * Probes are split into two buckets:
// - **Bootstrap probes** (file-system markers, sandbox-escape,
// `fork`, dyld images, URL-scheme handlers, runtime tamper).
// Cached after the first call so subsequent signing calls do
// not pay the cost. URL-scheme probes require MainActor
// (`UIApplication.canOpenURL`) so bootstrap MUST be invoked
// from the main thread.
// - **Per-call probe** (`P_TRACED` via `sysctl`). Re-evaluated
// on every `currentReport` because a debugger can attach
// after launch.
// * The classifier requires `>= 2 distinct positive jailbreak
// signals` before flagging `.jailbreakSuspected`. False
// positives on a single signal are common (an OS update can
// promote `/var/jb` to a default path, an Apple-internal tool
// can leave one of the marker files, etc.); requiring two
// independent signals raises the false-positive bar without
// materially helping a real jailbreak (which always trips
// several signals because they are a bundled set).
// * Debugger-attached and runtime-tamper are HARD signals: a
// single positive flips the classifier directly to
// `.debuggerAttachedInRelease` or `.runtimeTamperDetected`.
// Their false-positive rates are negligible (a Release build
// genuinely should not be debugged; a tampered bundle is
// unambiguously bad) and their attack severity is the highest.
// * The whole gate is feature-flagged via
// `TamperGatePolicy.kTamperGateEnabled`. Flipping that to
// `false` in an emergency disables the consent dialog, the
// banner, and the per-call assertion, but the `TamperReport`
// value is still computable for telemetry. Two TestFlight
// builds with telemetry on the false-positive rate are
// scheduled before the production flip.
// * Probes that can crash a debugger-attached DEBUG build
// (`PT_DENY_ATTACH`, `fork`) are gated on `#if !DEBUG`. The
// classifier itself is identical in DEBUG and Release so the
// report shape is identical and the behaviour is testable from
// a unit test target.
// Tradeoffs (design discipline):
// - Heuristic by nature. A nation-state attacker with custom
// tooling can spoof every signal. The combination with
// (bundle hash pin) is what gives defense-in-depth: a Frida
// script that also has to forge the SHA-256 of a 1+ MB JS
// bundle on every load is materially harder to write than a
// plain method-swizzle.
// - Probe set is intentionally a list (not a tightly coupled
// algorithm) so individual entries can be added, removed, or
// re-ordered as iOS major versions shift the jailbreak
// landscape. Each probe writes its own short string into
// `jailbreakSignals` so the bootstrap report is easy to
// diagnose without a debugger.
// - PT_DENY_ATTACH uses `dlsym` to look up `ptrace` instead of
// a static import. That keeps the symbol out of static
// analysis tools (App Store automated review historically
// flagged a direct import of `ptrace`); the runtime resolution
// is functionally identical and well-trodden by production
// iOS apps for years.
