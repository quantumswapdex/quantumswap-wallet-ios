// Strongbox.swift (Strongbox layer 5)
// In-memory accessor for the decrypted v2 strongbox payload.
// Owns the snapshot lifecycle (rebuilt on unlock, dropped on
// relock) and exposes typed getters/setters for every wallet-
// semantic field. Closes the call-site half of ``.
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// In an earlier shape of the app, every screen reached into
// `PrefConnect` directly to read or write a wallet-meaningful
// field. That made it structurally impossible to enforce the
// "only the encrypted strongbox holds wallet semantics"
// invariant: a single careless plaintext-pref write re-
// introduced the metadata leak.
// `Strongbox.shared` is the single replacement. Every wallet-
// meaningful read and write goes through this accessor.
// `PrefConnect` is restricted to the small UI-pref allowlist
// documented in `PrefConnect.swift`; any future PR that reads
// a wallet field via `PrefConnect` directly trips the
// grep-based invariant test under `QuantumCoinWalletTests`.
// Threading model: this class is `@unchecked Sendable` and
// coordinates internal state via a single `NSLock`. Reads
// are free across threads; writes serialize. The rationale
// for `NSLock` rather than an actor:
// 1. The existing call sites (`HomeWalletViewController`,
// `WalletsViewController`, `SendViewController`,
// `RestoreFlow`, etc.) are SYNC reads from MainActor-
// confined view-controller code. Wrapping every read in
// `await` would require a UI refactor far beyond the
// scope of .
// 2. The lock is held only across in-memory dictionary
// copies (microseconds). I/O happens outside the lock
// (write paths drop the lock, then call into layer 4 to
// re-encrypt and persist).
// Layered design:
// - This file knows about wallet semantics.
// - It does NOT know about the v2 file layout, MAC, or
// padding (those live in layers 1 / 2).
// - It does NOT know about cryptographic primitives.
// Persistence flows through `UnlockCoordinatorV2` (layer 4)
// -> `Aead.seal` -> `StrongboxPadding.pad` ->
// `StrongboxFileCodec.writeNewGeneration` ->
// `AtomicSlotWriter` (layers 1-3).
// Tradeoffs:
// - The "single in-memory snapshot" model is read-fast,
// write-slow: every mutation rebuilds and re-encrypts the
// entire payload. With 's 32 KiB bucket and 's
// two-slot rotation that is ~10-20 ms per write. User-
// driven mutations are rare enough that this is invisible.
// - Snapshot is wiped on `clearSnapshot` (called from idle-
// relock, sign-out, delete-all). After a wipe, every
// accessor returns its empty-state value (empty array,
// `nil`, `false`) so the UI degrades gracefully into the
// "locked" state without crashing.
// - The write paths require the user's password (to re-
// derive the MAC key + re-encrypt the strongbox). The
// password is collected by the caller via
// `UnlockDialogViewController` and threaded through
// `UnlockCoordinatorV2.appendWallet` /
// `replaceNetworks` / etc. mainKey is never cached
// across operations - every persist re-derives it via
// scrypt and zeroes the bytes on return.
