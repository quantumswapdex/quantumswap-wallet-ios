// BlockchainNetwork.swift
// Port of `BlockchainNetwork.java` and the Android
// `GlobalMethods.setActiveNetwork` flow. Loads
// `blockchain_networks.json` from the bundle (pre-unlock fallback),
// then layers in user-added networks restored from the encrypted
// strongbox payload once the wallet is unlocked, and re-points
// `ApiClient`, `Constants`, and the JS bridge on switch.
// iOS storage diverges from Android (which keeps custom networks in
// plaintext SharedPreferences). Here, every user-added network and the
// active-network offset travel inside the same encrypted blob the
// address map already lives in - one AES-GCM open per unlock recovers
// everything the UI needs, and the on-disk pref file shows opaque
// ciphertext rather than the user's network customisations.
// Android reference:
// app/src/main/java/com/quantumcoinwallet/app/model/BlockchainNetwork.java
// app/src/main/java/com/quantumcoinwallet/app/utils/GlobalMethods.java (setActiveNetwork)
//
// Concurrency discipline (the hardening of the security fix plan, closes
// the prior race / durability gaps):
// `BlockchainNetworkManager` mirrors the NSLock + private-storage
// pattern used by `Utilities/Constants.swift` for the legacy
// `SCAN_API_URL` / `RPC_ENDPOINT_URL` / `BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL` /
// `CHAIN_ID` mirrors. The lock holds across the entire mutation
// pipeline including the slow `persistThroughStrongboxLocked`
// scrypt + AEAD seal + slot-write window AND the rollback-on-throw
// branch, so a concurrent reader can never observe a torn or
// half-rolled-back `(networks, activeIndex)` pair. `applyActiveLocked`
// is the SINGLE publish point that fans the new snapshot out to
// `Constants.*`, `ApiClient.basePath`, and `NetworkConfig.publishSync`
// in the same critical section so all four observation surfaces see
// the same epoch (closing a prior race condition in concert with
// `Networking/NetworkConfig.swift`'s synchronous mirror).

    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // What it closes:
    //   The previous `public private(set) var networks` /
    //   `public private(set) var activeIndex` shape allowed concurrent
    //   readers (URLSession.delegate threads, UI listeners on the
    //   main queue, the JS bridge initialisation `Task.detached`) to
    //   observe `(networks, activeIndex)` mid-mutation. Swift `Array`
    //   and `Int` writes are not atomic at the language level - a
    //   reader could see the new `activeIndex` paired with the OLD
    //   `networks`, indexing past the end and either silently wrong-
    //   network'ing the user or crashing. Two simultaneous mutators
    //   (e.g. an "add network" `Task.detached` racing a "switch network"
    //   `Task.detached` that the user kicked off in two different
    //   sheets) could also leave the strongbox-on-disk and the
    //   in-memory state out of sync after a partial rollback.
    // Why this shape (NSLock + private storage + computed accessors):
    //   Mirrors the existing pattern in `Utilities/Constants.swift`
    //   for `SCAN_API_URL` / `RPC_ENDPOINT_URL` / `BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL` /
    //   `CHAIN_ID`. NSLock is sufficient: every mutation site is a
    //   user-tappable action (rare on the time scale of lock contention),
    //   the slow `persistThroughStrongbox` work runs while the lock is
    //   held, and the existing call sites are MainActor-confined sync
    //   UI code that cannot await on an actor without a UI refactor
    //   far beyond the scope of this fix. The serial discipline is the
    //   property we want.
    // Tradeoffs:
    //   The `persistThroughStrongbox` slow path (scrypt + AEAD seal +
    //   slot write, ~300-500 ms) runs while `_stateLock` is held.
    //   Worst case: a second user tap on a different mutator waits one
    //   user-tappable action for the first to complete. The alternative
    //   (drop the lock around the slow work + rollback dance) re-opens
    //   the race that this fix exists to close.
    // Cross-references:
    //   - (data race on
    //     `(networks, activeIndex)`) and a prior durability gap (compound mutation
    //     race specifically for double-tap "Add Network" sequences).
    //   - `QuantumCoinWallet/Utilities/Constants.swift` for the matching
    //     `_networkLock` + private backing pattern that this code mirrors.
    //   - `QuantumCoinWallet/Schema/StrongboxFileCodec.swift` for the
    //     analogous `writerQueue.sync` discipline on the codec side.
