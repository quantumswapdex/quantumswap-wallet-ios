// SnapshotRedactor.swift (UX layer)
// Hides every on-screen view when the app moves to
// the background so the iOS app-switcher snapshot does not leak
// sensitive content (seed phrases, wallet addresses, balances,
// pending transaction details).
// Why this exists:
// When iOS suspends an app, the system captures a snapshot of the
// app's current UI and shows it in the App Switcher (the
// horizontally-scrolling card UI a long-press / swipe-up exposes).
// That snapshot is stored on disk in the app's `Library/Caches/
// Snapshots/` directory and lives until iOS evicts it (often days,
// sometimes longer). It is read by:
// - The App Switcher itself (any user holding the unlocked
// device can scroll back to the snapshot).
// - Forensic disk imaging tools (the snapshot is plaintext
// PNG/JPG inside the device's filesystem, encrypted only by
// the platform's `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication`
// class, NOT `NSFileProtectionComplete` - so it is readable
// any time the device has been unlocked once since boot).
// - Cloud / device backups, depending on the user's iCloud
// posture.
// For a wallet that holds high-value assets, the worst case is a
// user navigating to "Reveal Seed Words", glancing at the seed,
// and then swiping up to multitask. iOS captures the seed-words
// screen as the snapshot. Any subsequent shoulder-surfer (or
// anyone who steals an unlocked device) can scroll the App
// Switcher and read the seed phrase from the captured image.
// How the overlay works:
// The cover is added to the foreground key window in
// `applicationWillResignActive` and removed in
// `applicationDidBecomeActive`. iOS takes the actual snapshot
// between `willResignActive` and `didEnterBackground`, so adding
// in `willResignActive` is the earliest available point and is
// visible by the time the snapshot is captured.
// The cover is opaque (background alpha = 1, no transparent
// pixels) and uses the brand primary color so the App Switcher
// shows a neutral branded card rather than a black rectangle (a
// black card looks like an OS bug; a branded card looks
// intentional and is what every other major wallet does).
// Why this is not just `view.isSecureTextEntry` or a screenshot
// disabler:
// iOS does not expose a public API to disable the App Switcher
// snapshot directly. There is no `UIApplication.disableSnapshot`
// or equivalent. The overlay-on-resign approach is the long-
// standing community-standard workaround and is what every
// privacy-sensitive iOS app uses (1Password, Signal, every major
// banking app).
// Tradeoff:
// The user briefly sees a branded splash card in the App
// Switcher rather than the live state of their wallet. Because
// we re-show the live state on `didBecomeActive`, the user does
// not notice this in normal use.
