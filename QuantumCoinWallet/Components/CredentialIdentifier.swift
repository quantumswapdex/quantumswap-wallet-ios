// CredentialIdentifier.swift
// MARK: - CredentialIdentifier
// Single source of truth for every Keychain `kSecAttrAccount`
// (a.k.a. "username") this app uses with iOS QuickType save /
// autofill. The shape of these strings encodes three isolation
// guarantees that downstream Reviewers and reviewers should
// verify whenever a new screen starts saving a password:
// 1. CONTEXT ISOLATION (strongbox vs. backup). Strongbox credentials
// live under `QuantumCoin-<deviceSuffix>`; backup-file
// credentials live under `QuantumCoin-backup-<address>-<deviceSuffix>`.
// Distinct prefixes mean a Save in one context can never
// overwrite the other context's slot.
// 2. PER-WALLET BACKUP ISOLATION. Every backup-file save
// includes the wallet `<address>` in the username, so
// saving the backup password for wallet 0xABC cannot
// overwrite the saved backup password for wallet 0xDEF.
// 3. CROSS-DEVICE ISOLATION. Every username ends in
// `-<deviceSuffix>` derived from `UIDevice.identifierForVendor`
// (with a Keychain-stored UUID fallback - see deviceSuffix
// comment). `identifierForVendor` is stable across launches
// for the lifetime of the install on a given device, and is
// NOT shared with other devices even on the same Apple ID -
// Apple derives it per-(vendor, device-install) and never
// syncs it. iCloud Keychain may sync the actual saved
// Keychain credential between devices, but each device
// queries with its OWN suffix, so:
// - Device A never autofills Device B's strongbox password.
// - A Save on Device A only overwrites Device A's slot.
// design clarifications:
// * `identifierForVendor` returns nil briefly during early
// boot on some devices, after a restore-from-backup race,
// or in App Extensions. The fallback UUID handles those
// cases.
// * The fallback UUID is stored in a Keychain item with
// `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` (NOT in
// UserDefaults as historically). UserDefaults is included
// in iCloud Backup by default, which would defeat the
// cross-device-isolation invariant - an iCloud-restored
// second device would inherit the first device's UUID
// fallback, recreating the silent-overwrite failure mode.
// ThisDeviceOnly Keychain items are not eligible for
// either iCloud Keychain sync or iCloud Backup, so the
// UUID is re-generated fresh on a restored device.
// * On uninstall + reinstall, both `identifierForVendor`
// and the Keychain fallback are reset (iOS 10.3+ deletes
// the app's Keychain items on uninstall). The new
// deviceSuffix means previously-saved Keychain credentials
// become orphaned (still in iCloud Keychain, but
// unreachable by the new suffix). Acceptable: a fresh
// install is a fresh state by design.
// SECURITY/UX TRADEOFF: storing the unlock or backup password in
// the iOS Keychain at all is a user-convenience choice. The user
// can opt out at any time by:
// - Declining the system "Save Password?" sheet shown after
// `.newPassword` flows submit (no Keychain write happens).
// - Tapping the QuickType key icon and picking a different
// saved password (or just typing a fresh one) on any screen.
// - Disabling Settings > Passwords > AutoFill Passwords for
// this app system-wide.
// We never call `SecItemAdd` / `SecItemCopyMatching` ourselves;
// iOS owns the save / autofill UI end-to-end. No new entitlements
// or `Info.plist` keys are required.
// Android parity: the Kotlin `CredentialIdentifier` object in the
// `quantum-coin-wallet-android` repo MUST produce byte-identical
// strings so a user signed into the same Apple ID and Google
// account sees matching account names in iCloud Keychain and
// Google Password Manager respectively. See plan section 3 for
// the cross-platform invariant tests.
