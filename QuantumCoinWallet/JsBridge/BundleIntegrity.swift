// BundleIntegrity.swift (JsBridge layer)
// Runtime hash check for the JavaScript bundle the
// `JsEngine` loads into `WKWebView`. Re-hashes the loaded bundle on
// first use and compares against the build-time SHA-256 embedded by
// `scripts/embed_bundle_hash.sh` into `BundleHash_Generated.swift`.
// Why this exists:
// The JS bundle owns every signing primitive in the wallet
// (scrypt KDF, AES-GCM envelope, EIP-155 transaction signing).
// Prior reviews flagged that the bundle is loaded
// into `WKWebView` and trusted absolutely - there is no
// integrity check between "what was built" and "what is
// running". The ways the bundle could be tampered without this
// check include:
// * App-binary patch on a jailbroken device: the on-disk
// resource is rewritten by an attacker who has root.
// * Re-sign with a malicious bundle: an Enterprise / sideload
// distributor swaps the bundle and re-signs. The Apple
// App-Store binary signature does NOT cover individual
// resource bytes once the bundle has been re-signed by a
// different team.
// * Mach-O instrumentation framework that hot-patches the
// evaluated source via `JavaScriptCore` reach. A Frida-class
// attacker can intercept the WKUserContentController setup
// and rewrite the bundle just before evaluation.
// This component closes the on-disk and re-sign cases by:
// 1. Hashing the bundle bytes at the SAME location the
// `WKURLSchemeHandler` will read from (`Bundle.main.url(for:)`).
// 2. Comparing to a constant whose value lives inside the
// Swift binary, where it inherits the binary's signature.
// A re-signer has to match the embedded hash to the new
// bundle, which means modifying the Swift constant -
// which means modifying the binary - which invalidates
// the signature unless the re-signer also has the
// original signing identity.
// The Frida-class case is partially closed: the runtime hash
// matches what is on disk, so a hot-patch that targets the
// already-loaded JS context is undetected at this layer.
// (TamperGate) layers on top with dyld-image walking and a
// debugger-attached check; that is where the runtime
// instrumentation case is addressed. together
// give a defense-in-depth that requires the attacker to bypass
// BOTH (file-bytes match AND runtime not instrumented).
// Tradeoffs:
// - The hash check adds ~10-20 ms at first JS-bridge use. We
// pay it lazily so the splash screen and unlock dialog are
// not affected; the cost is incurred just before the first
// `JsBridge.initialize` call.
// - A bundle update without a corresponding rebuild fails the
// check. This is the desired behaviour: shipping the bundle
// out-of-band is exactly the attack class we are detecting.
// The build script regenerates the constant on every Xcode
// build, so out-of-date hashes are impossible by construction
// for builds that go through the normal pipeline.
// - On mismatch we throw rather than crash. Callers
// (`JsEngine.shared.evaluate(...)` precondition) translate
// the throw into a hard refuse-to-initialize. prior reviews'
// intent is "fail loud", not "silent fallback to legacy
// bundle".
