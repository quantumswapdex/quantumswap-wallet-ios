// AtomicSlotWriter.swift (Storage layer 1)
// Two-slot rotating, durably-flushed, file-protection-class-
// `complete` writer for the v2 strongbox file format. Closes
// `` (file protection class) and `` (crash-safe two-
// slot rotation with `F_FULLFSYNC`).
// Verify-before-promote layer (added by the durability fix of the durability
// fix plan):
// `writeAndVerify(_:to:verify:onPhase:)` is the canonical write
// entry point. After F_FULLFSYNCing the .tmp fd it re-reads the
// staged bytes from disk with `[.uncached]` so the read traverses
// the OS's page-cache flush boundary, hands them to the caller's
// `verify` closure, and ONLY THEN renames the .tmp into place.
// The caller-supplied verify closure is the schema-aware integrity
// check (see `StrongboxFileCodec.writeNewGeneration` for the
// canonical eight-step deep verify). The three failure classes
// this catches:
//   - encoder / MAC / padding bugs that produce a structurally
//     valid file the unlock path cannot decrypt
//   - silent NAND bit-flips during the write window (the uncached
//     re-read traverses the page-cache flush boundary)
//   - stale-key MAC failures (the macKey we wrote with does not
//     match what we'd derive from the password we just used to
//     seal the wraps)
// This is the third defense layer (after two-slot rotation and
// F_FULLFSYNC) called out in the security findings doc's
// "Defense layering" paragraph; it closes the durability gap and
// backstops a prior durability gap. The existing single-arg
// `write(_:to:)` is a thin wrapper that calls `writeAndVerify`
// with a no-op verify so callers that don't need the deep verify
// (the codec's re-mirror path) compile unchanged.
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// The legacy `PrefConnect`-backed write path (`writeJson`
// then `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)`) is robust against
// *abrupt-app-kill* (SIGKILL during write -> rename either
// succeeded or didn't), but it is NOT robust against
// *power-loss* on iOS:
// - `.atomic` translates to "write to .tmp, then rename".
// The rename is atomic at the FILE-SYSTEM-METADATA
// level, but iOS's file system caches the metadata
// update in the journal until a flush event; a power
// cut between rename-completed and journal-flushed can
// leave the on-disk state with the OLD file present
// and the NEW file's data blocks orphaned. On the next
// boot we read the OLD file and silently lose every
// wallet add the user did since the last flush.
// - Worse, depending on timing, a partial-write of a
// single file can leave a half-written JSON whose
// `strongbox.ct` field is truncated; the AEAD tag check
// fails, and we throw "tamper detected" at the user
// on next launch when they did nothing wrong.
// The two-slot rotation defends against the first failure
// mode: we always have a previous-good slot, so a power-
// cut between writing slot B and reading it back leaves
// slot A intact and the next read picks A by `generation`.
// `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` defends against the second failure
// mode: it forces the bytes from the page cache through
// the device controller to the storage media, NOT just to
// the OS page cache (which is what `fsync` does on iOS,
// per Apple's "Performance and Stability" doc). Without
// `F_FULLFSYNC` a write that "succeeded" can still be lost
// if the device loses power within a few hundred ms.
// We call `F_FULLFSYNC` on TWO descriptors per write:
// * the data fd for the slot file we just wrote, AND
// * the parent-directory fd, so the rename's metadata
// update itself is durably committed.
// This is the procedure documented by Apple in TN1150()
// ("HFS Plus Volume Format") for crash-consistent journaled
// writes; the same pattern applies to APFS (the modern iOS
// default).
// Invariants this layer guarantees to layer 2 (`StrongboxFileCodec`):
// 1. After a successful `write(_:to:)` returns, the data is
// durably committed to flash, the file is named to the
// target slot, and the file-protection class is
// `complete`. A power-cut after this returns cannot lose
// it.
// 2. After a `write(_:to:)` THROW, the on-disk state is
// either:
// (a) entirely unchanged (the inactive slot's previous
// contents are intact), OR
// (b) the inactive slot has been freshly written (in
// which case the next read will pick it as the
// winner if its `generation` is higher).
// Layer 2 must therefore be prepared to find a new slot
// file even after a throw - that's correctness-
// preserving as long as the contents are MAC-valid.
// 3. `cleanupTempFiles` removes every `*.tmp` file in the
// prefs directory. Safe to run at boot - any genuine
// `*.tmp` from a non-crashed write is short-lived and
// will not be present at boot.
// 4. `read(slot:)` returns the raw bytes of `slot` if the
// file exists, `nil` otherwise. NO content interpretation
// happens at this layer. Layer 2 owns JSON decode, MAC
// check, and the slot-picker logic.
// 5. File protection class on every successful write is
// `complete`. If the user's screen is locked, the file
// body is unreadable until the next unlock. Closes
// ``.
// Tradeoffs:
// - F_FULLFSYNC is observably slower than fsync (~5-30 ms
// per write on modern iPhones; up to ~200 ms on older
// devices). With 's 32 KiB bucket and the user-
// driven write rate (one write per UI action), the cost
// is below user perception thresholds.
// - Two-slot rotation doubles the on-disk footprint (~64
// KiB total). Negligible vs. user data on any iOS device.
// - We deliberately use `Application Support/` rather than
// `Documents/` for the slot files. has already
// disabled `UIFileSharingEnabled` and
// `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`, so the practical
// visibility is the same; using `Application Support/` is
// the documented Apple convention for app-managed data
// (vs. user-visible documents). Slot files are `.json`-
// suffixed for human-debuggability of the schema; an
// attacker reading them sees opaque base64 either way.
