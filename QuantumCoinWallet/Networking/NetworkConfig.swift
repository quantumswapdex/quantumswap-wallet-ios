// NetworkConfig.swift (Networking layer)
// Actor-backed network configuration with
// a value-type `NetworkSnapshot` that signing call sites capture at
// "Review" time and re-assert against at "Submit" time.
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// The legacy state lived in `Constants.SCAN_API_URL`,
// `Constants.RPC_ENDPOINT_URL`, `Constants.BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL`,
// and `Constants.CHAIN_ID` - all declared as
// `nonisolated(unsafe) static var`. Three race-class problems:
// 1. **Signing-path race.** `SendViewController.presentUnlockAndSend`
// captures the active chain-id at the moment the user taps
// "Review", but the bridge call that signs the transaction
// re-reads `Constants.CHAIN_ID` and `Constants.RPC_ENDPOINT_URL`
// at submit time. If the user (or a detached
// `BlockchainNetworkManager.applyActive` task) toggles
// networks between review and submit, the signed transaction
// gets bound to a different chain-id than the user
// confirmed - producing a mis-bound EIP-155 signature that
// replays on the wrong chain.
// 2. **Concurrent-init race.** `applyActive` schedules a detached
// `JsBridge.initialize(...)` task. If the user then triggers
// another network switch before that task completes, the two
// initialise calls can interleave and leave the bridge in
// a hybrid state (RPC pointing one place, chain-id pointing
// another).
// 3. **Reader-of-stale-constants race.** Any UI surface that
// displays the network name, address-strip explorer button,
// token-row contract link, etc. reads from Constants. With
// no synchronisation, the read can tear (Swift's String is
// not atomic on assignment).
// The fix is to introduce an actor whose `current` is the source
// of truth, and have signing call sites capture an immutable
// `NetworkSnapshot` value at the moment of user intent. The
// actor's `apply(_:)` is the only mutation entry point. The
// legacy `Constants.*` mirrors are kept in sync from the actor
// so non-signing read sites (UI display, deep links) continue
// to work unchanged - they accept the existing tearing risk for
// a cosmetic value, while the signing path has a correctness-
// critical guarantee via the captured snapshot.
// Tradeoffs:
// - Actors require async access. The signing pipeline is already
// a `Task.detached`, so this is a natural fit. Synchronous read
// sites continue to read `Constants.*` mirrors; we accept the
// cosmetic-only tearing risk on those because the failure mode
// is "address strip briefly shows the old network name" rather
// than "signed a tx with the wrong chain-id".
// - The post-submit assertion catches the cross-flight
// toggle case where the user (or a programmatic switch)
// changed networks between Review and Submit. The actor's
// value-type snapshot makes the comparison cheap and total
// (`Equatable`).
// - layers on TOP of this: the same captured snapshot is
// forwarded to the bridge call and re-asserted at submit time
// against (a) the actor's current state and (b) the wallet's
// current address-for-index binding, so a wallet-switch-mid-
// flight (e.g. user backgrounded the app, switched wallets,
// foregrounded) ALSO aborts with an explicit error.

// Synchronous mirror of the actor's snapshot.
// What it closes:
//   The actor `apply(_:)` runs inside a `Task { await ... }`, so when
//   `BlockchainNetworkManager.applyActiveLocked()` returns, the actor
//   has NOT yet observed the new snapshot. A synchronous reader on
//   the same runloop tick (e.g. the user immediately tapping "Review"
//   in `SendViewController` after a network switch) reads from
//   `Constants.*` (which IS up-to-date) but `await NetworkConfig.shared.current`
//   in the same Task hop returns the OLD snapshot - a torn view between
//   the two sources of truth. This is a prior race condition.
// Why this shape (static NSLock + nonisolated(unsafe) storage):
//   Cannot be added to the `actor` itself: actors are async-only by
//   definition, and the whole point of this mirror is a synchronous
//   read. A standalone NSLock + nonisolated storage provides the
//   sync-read semantics with the same memory-safety guarantees as
//   the existing `Constants.*` mirrors. The actor remains the
//   canonical async source; this is the canonical sync source. The
//   two are kept in sync because `applyActiveLocked` calls
//   `publishSync` AND schedules the actor `apply(_:)` in the same
//   critical section.
// Tradeoffs:
//   Slight duplication: the same `NetworkSnapshot` is held in two
//   places (the actor's `snapshot` and this static `_syncSnapshot`).
//   Acceptable because the value type is small (a few Strings + an
//   Int) and both writes happen inside the BlockchainNetworkManager's
//   `_stateLock` window so they cannot drift.
// Cross-references:
//   - a prior race condition (NetworkConfig actor publish lag).
//   - `BlockchainNetwork.swift` `applyActiveLocked()` is the only
//     legitimate writer. SendViewController.presentReviewDialog is
//     the canonical reader (sync capture at "Review" tap).
//   - The async `current` accessor on the actor remains the right
//     read for the signing-path SUBMIT-time re-assertion (which is
//     already inside an `await` context and benefits from actor
//     ordering guarantees against a mid-flight `apply`).
