// StrongboxFileCodec.swift (Schema layer 2)
// V2 strongbox file codec: JSON shape, file-level MAC compute /
// verify, two-slot read selector, encode + write coordinator.
// Closes `` (rename top-level fields), `` (file-level
// MAC + rollback detection), and the schema half of ``
// (Strongbox accessor).
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// This is the *only* file in the wallet that knows the v2
// slot-file JSON shape. Every other layer either:
// * Layer 1 sees only opaque bytes (`AtomicSlotWriter`).
// * Layer 3 sees only AEAD primitives (`Aead`, `Mac`).
// * Layer 4 sees a typed decode result (`DecodedFile`)
// with fields like `salt`, `passwordWrap`, `strongbox`,
// `mac` and never touches their JSON form.
// * Layer 5 sees the post-MAC-verified, post-AEAD-opened,
// post-padding-stripped `StrongboxPayload`.
// Concentrating the schema knowledge here means a future
// schema bump (v2 -> v3) only edits this file plus the
// migration appendix. Reviewing the schema does not require
// reading any other layer.
// On-disk layout (canonical JSON, single source of truth here):
// {
// "v": 2,
// "generation": <Int>,
// "kdf": {
// "algorithm": "scrypt",
// "salt": "<base64, 16 bytes>",
// "params": { "N": ..., "r": ..., "p": ..., "keyLen": ... }
// },
// "wrap": {
// "passwordWrap": <Aead envelope>,
// "keychainWrap": <Aead envelope, optional>
// },
// "strongbox": <Aead envelope wrapping a StrongboxPayload padded to
// exactly 32 KiB>,
// "uiBlockHash": "<base64, 32 bytes>", // SHA-256 of canonical(ui)
// "mac": "<base64, 32 bytes>",
// "ui": { /* opt-in non-secret prefs */ }
// }
// The MAC scope is explicitly: a canonicalised JSON of
// `{v, generation, kdf, wrap, strongbox, uiBlockHash}`. The
// `ui` block ITSELF is not in the MAC scope (so a UI pref
// change can be written without re-deriving the MAC key,
// which would require the user's password); but the SHA-256
// of the canonical `ui` block IS in the MAC scope (via the
// `uiBlockHash` field) so an attacker who swaps two slot
// files' `ui` blocks - or replaces one slot's `ui` block
// with attacker-chosen contents - cannot re-bind it under
// the original MAC.
// (notes for reviewers):
// the empty-ui case hashes the canonical bytes `{}`
// (`JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: [:],
// options: [.sortedKeys])`), giving a single well-defined
// hash for "no ui prefs". A genuine first-write writes
// `uiBlock = [:]` and stores the corresponding 32-byte
// hash; on read the codec re-hashes the on-disk `ui` block
// (or the canonical empty object if the field is absent)
// and rejects a slot whose `uiBlockHash` does not match.
// Read algorithm:
// 1. AtomicSlotWriter.cleanupTempFiles.
// 2. Read both slots. JSON-parse + schema-version each.
// 3. Pre-MAC trial: AEAD-tag-check `passwordWrap` and
// `strongbox` on each parsed slot. Mark INVALID on tag fail.
// 4. Pick winner = highest `generation` among VALID slots.
// One-valid-only path schedules an async re-mirror.
// Both-INVALID path -> tamperDetected.
// 5. Return the winner to layer 4 for password-unlock. The
// file-level MAC is verified inside layer 4 AFTER mainKey
// recovery (we cannot verify it pre-unlock because the
// MAC key is HKDF(mainKey, kdf.salt, "integrity-v2")).
// Write algorithm:
// 1. Encode the new state into the v2 JSON shape.
// 2. Compute `mac` = HMAC-SHA256 over canonical JSON of
// `{v, generation, kdf, wrap, strongbox}`.
// 3. Hand the bytes to AtomicSlotWriter.write(toInactive).
// Tradeoffs:
// - The `mac` field is computed AFTER everything else is
// populated; a future schema add (e.g. a `policy` block)
// MUST be added to the canonicalised-JSON scope or it
// will be silently dropable / forgeable. The verification
// checklist in `QuantumCoinWalletTests` includes a grep test
// for "fields outside the MAC scope" to catch this regression.
// - Pre-MAC trial uses AEAD tag check (no plaintext output)
// so it costs ~ a microsecond per slot. The strict
// `Aead.open` length guard ALSO fires here so
// any 16-byte combined-input attack on `strongbox.ct` fails
// at the codec layer before reaching CryptoKit.
// - The `ui` block's per-entry MAC uses `deviceUiKey`
// (per-device, ThisDeviceOnly Keychain item). It does
// NOT travel via iCloud backup. A device migration sees
// `ui` entries with an unknown MAC and treats them as
// missing, causing the UI to fall back to its defaults
// (re-show EULA, re-pick language). Acceptable for a
// non-secret, low-friction first-launch path.
