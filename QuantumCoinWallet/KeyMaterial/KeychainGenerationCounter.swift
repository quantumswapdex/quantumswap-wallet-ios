// KeychainGenerationCounter.swift (KeyMaterial layer)
// Per-device monotonic anti-rollback counter for the strongbox
// slot-file generation.
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// The strongbox file-level MAC covers `{v, generation, kdf,
// wrap, strongbox}`, so an attacker cannot mutate the
// `generation` field of an INDIVIDUAL slot without breaking
// the MAC. The MAC, however, only proves intra-file
// consistency: a snapshot of BOTH slots taken at generation
// `N` is internally consistent, signed under the user's
// password, and remains MAC-valid forever. Without an
// out-of-file high-water mark, an attacker who can write to
// the app container can:
// 1. Snapshot both slot files at generation N.
// 2. Wait while the user performs legitimate writes that
// bump both slots to generation N+k.
// 3. Restore the snapshotted slot files.
// The replayed pair still passes MAC verification, and
// `readWinner` selects the higher of the two replayed
// generations - which is N, not N+k - silently rolling the
// wallet's address list, network list, and feature flags
// back to a prior state.
// This counter is the high-water mark. It lives in Keychain
// with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` and
// `kSecAttrSynchronizable=false`, mirroring the posture of
// `KeychainWrapStore`. The unlock path rejects any decoded
// slot whose `generation` is LESS than the counter; the
// persist path bumps the counter AFTER the slot's atomic
// rename + F_FULLFSYNC succeeds.
// Tradeoffs:
// - The counter is `ThisDeviceOnly` (matching the wrap key),
// so it is stripped from a cross-device iCloud restore. On
// a freshly-restored device the counter is absent. We
// SEED the counter from `decoded.generation` on first
// unlock when the counter is absent (see
// `UnlockCoordinatorV2.unlockWithPassword`); from then on
// the device-local high-water mark engages. The rollback
// window on a fresh device is bounded by the most recent
// backup, which is the same window the user already
// accepts for any backup-based recovery.
// - Power-loss safety: the persist sequence is
// `writeNewGeneration` (atomic rename + F_FULLFSYNC) THEN
// `bump(to:)`. A crash between these two steps leaves
// `disk_gen > counter`, which is benign - the next unlock
// just bumps the counter forward to the disk value. The
// opposite ordering (bump first, then write) would leave
// `disk_gen < counter` after a crash and would trigger a
// false rollback rejection; this would brick a legitimately
// unlucky user. We deliberately commit to the storage-
// before-counter ordering for this reason.
// - Counter reset on uninstall: iOS purges Keychain items
// when the app is uninstalled (since iOS 10.3). A
// determined attacker can reinstall to reset the counter.
// That requires either physical device access (and the
// Apple ID password to reinstall via the App Store) or a
// developer-mode sideload channel - both of which are
// out-of-scope for the user-mode threat model. The slot
// files in `Application Support/` are also deleted on
// uninstall, so reinstall is also "lose the strongbox";
// the counter reset is a non-issue when the thing being
// protected is also gone.
// - Account scope: the counter Keychain item is keyed by a
// `service` distinct from `KeychainWrapStore` so the two
// can be deleted / queried independently. A future
// `factory-reset` UI flow may want to nuke just the
// counter (e.g. "I am intentionally rolling back to a
// known-good snapshot") without losing the wrap key.
