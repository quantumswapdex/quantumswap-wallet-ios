// SecureRandom.swift (Crypto layer 3)
// (CRITICAL): single-source-of-truth wrapper for
// `SecRandomCopyBytes`. Direct calls to `SecRandomCopyBytes`
// anywhere else in the codebase are a build-blocking lint
// failure: every random byte the wallet ever consumes (envelope
// nonces, KDF salts, recipient addresses for sandbox-escape
// probes, file names) MUST be observed to throw on RNG failure
// rather than silently returning zero bytes.
// Why this exists (notes for reviewers):
// `SecRandomCopyBytes(_:_:_:)` returns an `OSStatus`. On
// failure the destination buffer is left untouched, which in
// our usage means it stays zero-initialized:
// var out = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: count) // already zero
// _ = SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, count, &out)
// return Data(out) // potentially still all zeros
// The previous `_ = SecRandomCopyBytes(...)` pattern at three
// storage-layer call sites (KDF salt generation, main-key
// generation, AES-GCM nonce generation) discarded the status
// completely. A failed RNG draw therefore produced:
// - An all-zero scrypt salt -> all wallets on the device
// collapse to the same KDF lattice; one cracked password
// cracks every install with the same failure mode.
// - An all-zero `mainKey` -> the AES-GCM key is a known
// constant; every encrypted blob can be decrypted offline.
// - An all-zero AES-GCM nonce reused across multiple
// encryptions of the same key -> CATASTROPHIC: GCM
// confidentiality and authenticity are both destroyed
// (nonce reuse leaks the authentication key, which lets
// an attacker forge arbitrary ciphertexts).
// This is the kind of failure that:
// * is undetectable by the user (ciphertext "looks random"),
// * is irreversible (already-leaked plaintext cannot be
// un-leaked),
// * is silent (no crash, no log line, no UI surface),
// * is permanent (the on-disk state is now permanently
// compromised).
// Multiple security reviews independently flagged this.
// grok-4.20, gemini-3.1-pro) flagged this exact pattern. The
// CRITICAL severity is shared by all five.
// The remediation is mechanical: every call site must check the
// `OSStatus` and fail loud on `!= errSecSuccess`. Centralising
// the check in one wrapper is the only way to make this
// regression-proof: the lint rule "no direct call to
// `SecRandomCopyBytes` outside this file" is grep-checkable
// from CI and reviewable from a code review.
// Tradeoffs:
// - Throwing changes the function signature of the call sites.
// Some of those sites are in non-throwing helpers and have to
// be converted to `throws`. That's a tractable, mechanical
// refactor; the only friction is correctness of error mapping
// in callers.
// - Probe-style call sites (`TamperGate.probeSandboxEscape`,
// `CloudBackupManager.randomHexSuffix`) only use the bytes
// for non-secret uniqueness (a temp-file name, a probe file
// name). For those we accept a degraded fallback (pid /
// timestamp) on `try?` failure rather than aborting the whole
// call - documented inline at each call site. The wrapper
// itself ALWAYS throws on RNG failure; the choice to treat a
// throw as "degrade and continue" lives at the call site so
// a future reviewer can see the policy decision in context.
// Relationship to the 5/5 design finding :
// Prior reviews specifically called out three storage-layer
// sites in the original keystore implementation:
// - KDF salt generation -> migrated.
// - main-key generation -> migrated.
// - private `randomBytes` helper used for AES-GCM nonces ->
// migrated.
// plus the two probe-only sites added by Track B work items
// ``/`` (CloudBackupManager) and `` (TamperGate)
// which inherit the same wrapper. After migration, this file is
// the one and only `SecRandomCopyBytes` caller in the repo.
