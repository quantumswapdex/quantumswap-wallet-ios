// Mac.swift (Crypto layer 3)
// HMAC-SHA256 and HKDF-SHA256 (RFC 5869) primitives used by the
// v2 strongbox file format for:
// - File-level integrity MAC (`mac` field at the top of every
// slot file). Detects on-disk tampering and rollback /
// stale-slot swap.
// - HKDF-Expand to derive the file-level MAC key from the
// strongbox `mainKey`, salted by `kdf.salt`, with info string
// `"integrity-v2"`. The derivation is reproducible and
// covered by the unit-test vectors.
// - HKDF-Expand to derive the per-`ui` HMAC key from the
// device-only `deviceUiKey` Keychain secret. Lets the
// pre-unlock UI namespace (EULA flag, language code) be
// tamper-detected without requiring a wallet unlock.
// Design discipline (notes for reviewers):
// * This file is the only call site for `HMAC<SHA256>` and
// `HKDF<SHA256>` in the wallet. Other layers (especially
// layer 2 `StrongboxFileCodec`) call into the `Mac` enum here
// so the integrity primitive is reviewable in one place.
// * `verify(_:mac:keyBytes:)` uses CryptoKit's
// constant-time `isValidAuthenticationCode`, NOT `==`. A
// timing-safe MAC comparison closes a class of side-
// channel attacks where an attacker who can measure
// decryption latency learns one byte of the MAC at a time.
// The leak is bounded in our process model (no remote MAC
// oracle), but writing the constant-time comparison is
// free and removes the entire class of concern.
// * `hkdfExtractAndExpand(_:salt:info:length:)` runs RFC 5869
// §2.2 Extract followed by §2.3 Expand. Apple's
// `HKDF.deriveKey(...)` performs both phases internally;
// the function name was renamed from `hkdfExpand` to
// `hkdfExtractAndExpand` to make prior reviews
// invariant ("this function does NOT skip Extract") visible
// at every call site rather than buried in a doc comment.
// For our IKM (the 32-byte AES-GCM `mainKey`), Extract is
// strictly redundant cryptographically because the IKM is
// already uniformly random; the redundancy costs ~1 µs and
// the explicit Extract step makes cross-platform KAT
// vectors easier to compare against `RFC 5869 Appendix A`
// reference implementations.
// Tradeoffs:
// - We use Apple's `CryptoKit` HKDF rather than rolling our
// own. CryptoKit is FIPS-validated, well-fuzzed, and
// hardware-accelerated where the device supports it. The
// alternative (a pure-Swift HKDF in this file for cross-
// platform parity with Android) would be reviewable but
// would duplicate code that Apple already maintains. We
// accept the platform-native choice and document the
// parity contract in `Schema/StrongboxFileCodec.swift` (the
// KAT vectors for the derivation are listed there so
// Android's implementation can self-check).
// - The KAT vectors below (`Mac.hkdfTestVectors`) are derived
// from RFC 5869 Appendix A.1 (basic SHA-256 case) and are
// asserted in `MacHkdfKatTests`. Any future change to the
// HKDF call shape that breaks bit-exact reproducibility
// against these vectors will fail the test, blocking merge.
