// RestoreFlow.swift
// Coordinates restore-from-file and restore-from-cloud-folder flows.
// Mirrors the Android `WalletsFragment.runBatchedRestorePass` loop:
// * Load every candidate file up front (URL + JSON + address).
// * Show one BackupPasswordDialog listing all pending addresses.
// * On OK, present a WaitDialog with an updatable address line and
// "[CURRENT] of [TOTAL]" progress, then run the decrypt loop.
// * After the pass:
// - If every wallet decrypted (or was a duplicate), dismiss the
// dialog, surface a single "already exists" toast for any
// duplicates, and finish.
// - If some wallets decrypted, dismiss + re-open the dialog with
// the shrunken pending list.
// - If no wallet decrypted, surface a modal "try a different
// password" dialog and re-enable the password dialog WITHOUT
// clearing the typed password.
// Persists wallets through `UnlockCoordinatorV2.appendWallet`, which
// updates `Strongbox.shared` in place so the wallet list / main strip /
// Receive screen all show the imported wallet without a relaunch.
